The past two years and a half research would be much harder without the guidance of my supervisor, the assistance from my friends and the support of my parents.

First of all, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor Prof. Qiang Yang for his kindly instructions on both my research and my life. Without the guidance of Prof. Yang, I would never have the chance to exploit so many possibilities in my life. Also I would never be able to explore my interest in the area of recommender system. 

I would like to express my great thankfulness to Lili Zhao and Liya Ji for their companionship and valuable suggestions on my study, also for their kindness and tolerance as a childish boy's roommate. 

I would like to thank Ben Tan, Bo Liu, Bin Wu, Kaixiang Mo, Zhongqi Lv, Lianghao Li for their ideas, suggestion and company. And thank Dr. Wei Xiang and Dr. Qian Xu for their guidance in future career. In addition, I would like to thank Dr. Yong Li, Xiaoping Lai, Xiaopeng Zhang, Lei Xiao for their encouragement and criticism.

I am grateful to Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung and Prof. Chi-Wing Wong for serving in the thesis examination committee. And many thanks to the CSE staffs, Mr. Isaac Ma and Ms. Connie Lau, for their administration work.

Finally, I am thankful to my mom for her support and belief. 

Wish all my friends good luck, and have fun!
