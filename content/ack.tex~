The past two years research would be much harder without the guidance of my supervisor, the assistance from my friends and the support of my parents.

First of all, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor Prof. Qiang Yang for his kindly instructions on both my research and my life. Without the supervision of Prof. Yang, I would never have been able to explore and to exploit in the area of recommender system.

I would like to show my appreciation to Dr. Wei Xiang, who gave me great help while developing my research topic on selective knowledge transfer. I would also like to thank Yin Zhu, Erheng Zhong, Weike Pan, Lili Zhao, Nathan Liu and Sinno Pan, who have been working closely with me in the past two years and gave valuable suggestions on my study. In addition, I want to thank Dr. Hao Hu, Dr. Vincent Zheng, Kaixiang Mo, Ben Tan, Bin Wu, Naiyan Wang and other fellow students for their companionship.

I am grateful to Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung and Prof. Chi-Wing Wong for serving in the thesis examination committee. And many thanks to the CSE staffs, Mr. Isaac Ma and Ms. Connie Lau, for their administration work.

Finally, I am thankful to my parents for their unreserved support all these years.
