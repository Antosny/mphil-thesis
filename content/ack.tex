The past two years and a half research would have been much harder without the guidance of my supervisor, assistance from my friends and support of my parents.

Firstly, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor Prof. Qiang Yang for his instruction on both my research and my life. Without his guidance, I would never have the chance to exploit so many possibilities, in particular my interest in recommender system.

I would also like to express my greatest appreciation to Lili Zhao and Liya Ji for their companionship and valuable suggestions on my study, also for their kindness and tolerance as my roommates.

In addition, I would like to thank Ben Tan, Bo Liu, Bin Wu, Kaixiang Mo, Zhongqi Lv, Lianghao Li for their ideas, suggestion and company. Also thanks to Dr. Wei Xiang and Dr. Qian Xu for their guidance on my future career. I would like to thank Dr. Yong Li, Xiaoping Lai, Xiaopeng Zhang, Lei Xiao for their encouragement and criticism.

I am grateful to Prof. Dit-Yan Yeung and Prof. Chi-Wing Wong for serving on my thesis examination committee. Many thanks to the CSE staffs, Mr. Isaac Ma and Ms. Connie Lau, for their administration work.

Finally, I am thankful to my mother for her support and belief in me.

I wish all my friends good luck, and have fun!
