One Class Recommender System aims at predicting users' future behaviors according to their historical actions. In these problems, the training data usually contain only binary data reflecting the behavior is happened or not. Thus, the data is sparser than traditional rating prediction problems.
Recently, there are two ways to tackle the problem. 1, using knowledge transferred from other domains to mitigate the data sparsity problem. 2, providing methods to distinguish negative data and unlabeled data.
However, it's not easy to simply transfer knowledge from source domain to target domain since their observations may be inconsistent. And without data from external source, distinguising negative and unlabeled data is sometimes infeasible.

In this paper, we propose a novel matrix tri-factorization method to transfer the useful information from source domain to target domain. Then we embed this method to a cluster-based SVD(singular value decomposition) framework.
In several real-world datasets, we show our method achieve better prediction precision than other state-of-the-art methods. The cluster-based SVD method has been online for 2 months in a online shopping site, and its performance is among the best.
