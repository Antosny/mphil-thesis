 abstract = {  In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based method for
   knowledge transfer. We model the transfer relationships between source
   tasks by embedding the set of learned source models in a graph using
   transferability as the metric. Transfer to a new problem proceeds by
   mapping the problem into the graph, then learning a function on this
   graph that automatically determines the parameters to transfer to the
   new learning task. This method is analogous to inductive transfer along a
   manifold that captures the transfer relationships between the tasks. We
   demonstrate improved transfer performance using this method against
   existing approaches in several real-world domains.}
